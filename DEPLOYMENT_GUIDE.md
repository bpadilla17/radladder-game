## STEP 2: SET UP SUPABASE DATABASE

### A. Go to Your Supabase Project
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com
2. Click on your project (you created this earlier)

### B. Create the Database Tables

2. Click **"API"** in the settings menu
3. You'll see:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public** key (long string of letters/numbers)

**IMPORTANT: Copy both of these! You'll need them soon!**

Write them down or keep this tab open.

## STEP 3: UPLOAD YOUR IMAGES TO SUPABASE

### A. Create Storage Bucket
1. In Supabase, click **"Storage"** on the left sidebar
2. Click **"New bucket"**
3. **Name:** `question-images`
4. **Public bucket:** Check this box (âœ…)

2. Click **"Upload file"**
3. Select ALL 16 of your renamed images

5. Wait for all images to upload

### C. Get Image URLs and Update SQL
Now you need to update the insert_questions.sql file with your actual image URLs.

1. In Storage, click on one of your images
2. At the top, you'll see a URL that looks like:
   `https://xxxxx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/croup_steeple_sign.png`
3. Copy everything EXCEPT the filename at the end. You want:
   `https://xxxxx.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/question-images/`
4. Open `database/insert_questions.sql` in a text editor
5. Find every instance of `YOUR_SUPABASE_URL` and replace it with your URL
   - Should be about 8 replacements (one per question)
6. Save the file

### D. Insert Your Questions
1. Go back to Supabase SQL Editor
2. Click **"New query"**
3. Copy ALL the text from your UPDATED `database/insert_questions.sql` file
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"**
6. You should see "8" as the total_questions count

**âœ… All 8 questions loaded into database!**

1. On the configuration screen, find **"Environment Variables"**
2. Add these two variables:

**Variable 1:**
- **Name:** `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- **Value:** Paste your Supabase Project URL (from Step 2C)

**Variable 2:**
- **Name:** `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Value:** Paste your Supabase anon public key (from Step 2C)

3. Make sure both are added, then scroll down

### C. Deploy!
1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Wait 2-3 minutes while Vercel builds your game
3. You'll see "Building..." then "Deploying..." then "Success!"

**âœ… Your game is LIVE!**

### D. Get Your Game URL
1. After deployment, you'll see your game URL (looks like: `https://radladder-game-xxxxx.vercel.app`)
2. Click on it to open your game!

## STEP 5: TEST YOUR GAME

### A. Quick Test
1. Click "Start Game"

3. Try answering a question
4. Make sure images load
5. Make sure the timer works
6. Try the lifelines

### B. If Something Doesn't Work

**Images not loading?**
- Check that your image URLs in the SQL are correct
- Make sure the Storage bucket is public
- Try clicking on an image in Supabase Storage and copying its URL

**Game won't start?**
- Check that your environment variables in Vercel are correct
- Make sure you copied the FULL URL and key (no spaces)
- Redeploy: Go to Vercel â†’ Deployments â†’ Click "..." â†’ "Redeploy"

**Database errors?**
- Make sure you ran BOTH SQL files (schema.sql AND insert_questions.sql)
- Check the SQL Editor for any error messages

## ðŸŽŠ YOU'RE DONE!

### Your game is live at your Vercel URL!

**Share it with your residents:**
1. Copy your Vercel URL
2. Post it in Synapse chat
3. Send via email/text
4. They just click and play!

### Next Steps:
- Test with 2-3 residents first
- Get feedback
- Add more questions later if you want
- Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ“ž TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Build Failed" on Vercel
- Check that you uploaded ALL files to GitHub (especially package.json)
- Make sure environment variables are set correctly

### "Cannot connect to database"
- Verify your VITE_SUPABASE_URL is correct
- Verify your VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is correct
- Make sure there are no extra spaces

### "No questions loading"
- Verify you ran insert_questions.sql
- Check that image URLs are correct (no YOUR_SUPABASE_URL remaining)
- Go to Supabase â†’ Table Editor â†’ questions â†’ verify 8 rows exist

### Game loads but images broken
- Check Storage bucket is public
- Verify image filenames match exactly (case-sensitive!)
- Try accessing an image URL directly in your browser

## ðŸŽ¯ QUICK REFERENCE

**Your URLs:**
- Game: `https://your-game.vercel.app`
- GitHub: `https://github.com/yourusername/radladder-game`
- Supabase: `https://app.supabase.com/project/your-project`
- Vercel: `https://vercel.com/your-username/radladder-game`

**To Update the Game Later:**
1. Make changes to files locally
2. Upload changed files to GitHub (same way as before)
3. Vercel will automatically redeploy!
